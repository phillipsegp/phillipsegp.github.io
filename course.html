          The AS Level English General Paper course encourages you to think
          critically about modern issues as a means of developing your skills
          in reading and writing. It also seeks to strengthen your ability to
          communicate in English. Your experiences in this course can help you
          become a stronger critical reader, writer and thinker.<br><br>

          Unlike some of your other classes, where you need to learn about and
          retain content-based material, AS Level English General Paper is a
          skills-based course. The skills you learn as a student on this course
          can transfer to most other academic fields you are studying, therefore
          your learning experiences can set a valuable foundation for your
          educational experience across all disciplines.<br><br>

          In short, the skills you practise in this course are extremely valuable
          because they are the ones that are required at university level, valued
          in the professional world, and necessary for citizens living in
          twenty-first century society.<br><br>

          <strong>Key Benefits</strong><br><br>
          This course can help you to:<br><br>
          <ul>
            <li>develop your own opinions</li>
            <li>analyse the opinions of others</li>
            <li>evaluate the quality, value or significance of ideas before judging them</li>
            <li>make new insights and enter the academic conversation.</li>
          </ul>
          <br><br>
          We are all shaped by our own experiences and hold different values,
          so not everyone sees the world in the same way. Learning how to address
          today’s issues (and the opinions surrounding them) in a sensitive and
          mature way can improve your approach to global conversation. It is hoped
          that success in this course will inspire you to play an active role in
          global society and as you do so, you may help to make positive changes
          in the world around you.
